I see data as more than just numbers—it's human behavior, decisions, and stories encoded in rows and columns. I’m driven by the idea that behind every dataset lies a pattern waiting to be uncovered and a decision waiting to be improved.

My journey with data has spanned building intelligent dashboards for Citi’s financial systems, designing predictive models, and even exploring how generative AI can responsibly shape the future of education.

My work has been recognized across domains—whether that’s ranking in the Top 5 out of 1000+ teams at a national IoT innovation challenge, earning a $5000 merit scholarship, or representing my graduate cohort as a student leader.

What excites me most is applying data in ways that are **useful, ethical, and human-centered**—from helping students learn better to forecasting city traffic, to building tools that make people pause and think.

I’m always up for meaningful problems, messy datasets, and good conversations.

Let’s connect. Let’s build.
